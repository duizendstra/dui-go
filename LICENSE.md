The specific scope of use (permitted purposes, users, locations, instances, etc.) is determined by the agreement *between Licensee and Consultant*, but in no event shall the use exceed what is reasonably necessary for Licensee's internal operations in connection with Consultant's services.

**3. Ownership & Confidentiality.**

The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest, including all intellectual property. The Software is confidential; Licensee shall protect it with at least reasonable care. This survives termination.

**4. Termination.**

This License may be terminated by Licensor immediately upon written notice if Licensee breaches this License.  This License *automatically terminates* if the agreement between Licensee and Consultant regarding the implementation/integration of the Software is terminated. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use and destroy all copies of the Software, certifying this in writing to Licensor. Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 survive termination.

**5. Disclaimer of Warranty.**

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

**6. Limitation of Liability.**

LICENSOR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE TO CONSULTANT FOR THE SERVICES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY.

**7. Governing Law.**

This License is governed by the laws of The Netherlands. Disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of The Netherlands.

**8. General.**

This License, *along with the agreement between Licensee and Consultant*, constitutes the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee regarding the Software. If any provision is invalid, the rest remain in effect. Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver. Licensee may not assign this License without Licensor's prior written consent.
